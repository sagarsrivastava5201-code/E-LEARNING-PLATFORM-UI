E-Learnify — E-Learning Platform UI

hi i'm sagar srivastava This project is a responsive and user-friendly front-end design for an online learning platform called E-Learnify. It is built using basic web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—making it lightweight, easy to understand, and highly customizable. The design aims to provide a smooth experience for users who want to browse courses, watch lessons, track progress, and manage their learning.

What This Project Does

Clear Navigation: A simple and clean navigation bar helps users move easily between Home, Courses, Dashboard, and Login pages. It highlights the current page for better user orientation.

Course Browsing: Users can view a list of available courses displayed as cards with images, titles, short descriptions, and buttons that direct them to log in before accessing course details.

Course Details: Each course has its own detailed page featuring a video lesson (embedded from YouTube) and a progress bar that visually shows how much of the course has been completed.

User Dashboard: After login, learners can see all the courses they are enrolled in, along with individual progress bars displaying their completion percentage for each course.

Login Page: A simple login form designed to collect user email and password for authentication (in this version, it’s a static form without backend).

Design Highlights

Clean and Modern: The UI uses calm shades of blue and violet, which create a trustworthy and professional look, perfect for educational platforms.

Mobile Friendly: Using responsive layouts and media queries, the design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes—from desktop monitors to mobile phones.

Smooth Interactions: Buttons and links have subtle hover effects for better user experience without being distracting.

Readable Typography: A mix of professional and friendly fonts (like the ‘Patrick Hand’ cursive for headings) makes the platform look approachable yet polished.

Technical Details

Uses semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO.

The CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts ensure flexible and clean structure.

JavaScript animates the progress bars smoothly on page load, showing basic interaction and DOM manipulation.

No frameworks or libraries are used, which keeps the project simple and easy to maintain.
